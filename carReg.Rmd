## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Cars93.
CarPrice_Assignment.

Scatterplots between price and other car variables for both datasets
`cor` to calculate correlation also.
To get variables that have strongest correlation with price.
Use the top 1-4 variables to make linreg model to predict price.
  Maybe do models for each of the variables with price.


Homework -> correlation and scatterplots between variables.
 horsepower -> mpg. length -> engine_size

  


Load both cars data

```{r}
cars93 <- read.csv("Cars93.csv")
cars_assign = read.csv("CarPrice_Assignment.csv")
```

Scatter

```{r}
cars93$Passengers
```

```{r}
cars93$Cylinders
```



```{r}
columns93 <- c("MPG.city", "MPG.highway", "EngineSize", "Horsepower", "RPM", "Rev.per.mile", "Fuel.tank.capacity", "Length", "Wheelbase", "Width", "Rear.seat.room", "Luggage.room", "Weight")

length(columns)
```

```{r}
```


```{r}
ggplot(cars93, aes(x = MPG.city, y = Price)) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
cars93[]
```


```{r}
for (var in columns93)
{
  print(var);
  p <- ggplot(cars93, aes_string(x = var, y = "Price")) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE);
  print(p);
  correlation <- cor(cars93$Price, cars93[[var]]);
  print(correlation)
}
```
```{r}
columns_assign <- c("wheelbase", "carlength", "carwidth", "carheight", "curbweight", "enginesize", "horsepower", "peakrpm", "citympg", "highwaympg", "price")
```


```{r}
for (var in columns_assign)
{
  print(var);
  p <- ggplot(cars_assign, aes_string(x = var, y = "price")) + 
   geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE);
  print(p);
  correlation <- cor(cars_assign$price, cars_assign[[var]]);
  print(correlation)
}
```





cars_assignment lin reg model
```{r}
model_assign <- lm(price ~ horsepower + enginesize + carlength + curbweight, data = cars_assign)
summary(model_assign)
```
